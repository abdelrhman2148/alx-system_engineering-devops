In this project, I gained hands-on experience in connecting to and managing servers using the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol. The project primarily revolves around tasks performed on a server provided by ALX.

Tasks Overview ðŸ“ƒ

1. Use a Private Key

    - **Task Name:** 0-use_a_private_key
    - **Description:** This task involves creating a Bash script that utilizes SSH to establish a connection to the Holberton-provided server. The script is designed to employ a private key for authentication.
    - **Example Usage:** `$ ./0-use_a_private_key`

2. Create an SSH Key Pair

    - **Task Name:** 1-create_ssh_key_pair
    - **Description:** Here, a Bash script is developed to generate an RSA key pair, essential for secure authentication via SSH.
    - **Example Usage:** `$ ./1-create_ssh_key_pair`

3. Client Configuration File

    - **Task Name:** 2-ssh_config
    - **Description:** This task entails configuring an SSH client configuration file to streamline the connection process. The file is set up to utilize the private key located at ~/.ssh/holberton and to enforce authentication refusal via password.
    - **Example Usage:** N/A (Configuration file modification)

For detailed instructions and implementation steps, refer to each task's respective script and documentation provided within the project directory.
